                Autonomous Vehicle
              </h2>
              <p className="text-white">
                Autonomous Vehicle is a wonder of modern AI technology which is
                capable of detecting its surroundings and functioning without
                any human intervention. To be considered completely autonomous,
                a vehicle must be able to go to a present location without human
                intervention on roads that have not been adapted for its usage.
                A driverless automobile must know the route, understand its
                environment, follow traffic regulations, and make accurate
                decisions while interacting with other cars and people on the
                road in order to arrive at its destination. The goal of
                autonomous cars is to eliminate the need for a driver, allowing
                all passengers to enjoy the ride. For this, technology must
                advance to a degree of security that can be relied upon. To
                achieve the goal numerous hardware, software and algorithms are
                working behind it. There is no such vehicle in Pakistan that has
                been made autopilot using technology. So, the purpose of this
                project is to make a self-driving autonomous car using
                technology. Our project includes both hardware and software. The
                biggest flash light of this project is

                We are thrilled to share that we had the incredible opportunity
                to participate in the SEE Pakistan Competition, where we had the
                privilege of representing our project, "Autonomous Vehicle." üöó
                It was an honor for us to be among the talented individuals who
                presented their innovative ideas and solutions. "Autonomous
                Vehicle" is a project close to my heart, representing countless
                hours of hard work, dedication, and collaboration. It's a
                testament to what can be achieved when passion meets technology.
                ü§ñ I want to express my gratitude to my mentors, teammates, and
                everyone who supported me throughout this journey. Your guidance
                and encouragement were instrumental in making this project a
                reality. I look forward to continuing to explore the limitless
                possibilities of software engineering and pushing the boundaries
                of technology. üåê Thank you all for your unwavering support, and
